TRANSCRIPTION REPORT: ARTHUR THE RAT
Total Duration: 03:45
==========================================

[00:00] The story of Arthur the Rat. Once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't
[00:06] make up his mind. Whenever the other rats asked him if he would like to come out
[00:11] hunting with them, he would answer in a hoarse voice, I don't know. And when they
[00:17] said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes or no either. He'd always
[00:25] shake making a choice. One fine day his Aunt Josephine said to him, now look here,
[00:32] no one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind
[00:37] of your own than a greasy old blade of grass. The young rat coughed and looked quiet as
[00:42] usual but said nothing. Don't you think so, said his aunt, stamping her foot, for she
[00:49] couldn't bear to see the young rat so cold-blooded. I don't know was all he
[00:56] ever answered and then he walked off to think.
[01:00] One night, the rats heard a loud noise in the loft.
[01:13] It was a very dreary old place, the roof let the rain come down, come washing in.
[01:20] The beams and the rafters had all rotted through, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.
[01:26] At last, one of the joists gave way, and the beams fell with one edge on the floor.
[01:36] The walls shook, the cupola fell off, and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.
[01:45] This won't do, said the leader. We can't stay cooped up here any longer.
[01:50] So they sent out scouts to search for a new home.
[01:54] A little later on that evening, the scouts came back and said they had found an old-fashioned horse farm.
[02:00] For there would be room board for all of them. The leader gave the order at once,
[02:05] continue following in. And the rats crawled out of the hole right away and stood on the floor in a long line.
[02:10] Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. That was the name of the
[02:16] shaker. He wasn't in the line and he wasn't exactly outside it. He stood just
[02:23] by it. Come on, get in line. Growled the old rat coarsely. Of course you're coming too.
[02:32] I don't know, said Arthur calmly. Why the idea of it. You don't think it's safe here
[02:39] anymore, do you? I'm not certain, said Arthur undaunted. The roof may not fall down yet.
[02:48] Well, said the old rat, you can't wait for us to, for you to join us. Then he
[02:53] turned to the other and shot it right about the face. Marked. And the long line
[02:57] marched out.
[03:00] I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.
[03:08] It's so nice and snug here, I guess I'll go back to my hole under the log for a while,
[03:15] just to make up my mind.
[03:18] But during the night, there was a big crash.
[03:21] Down came beams, rafters, joists, the whole business.
[03:25] Last morning, it was a foggy day, some men came to look over the damage.
[03:30] It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.
[03:33] But at last, one of them happened to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat,
[03:38] quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.
[03:42] Thus, the shirker got his due, and there was no mourning for him.
