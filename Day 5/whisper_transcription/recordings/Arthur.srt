00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
The story of Arthur the Rat. Once upon a time there was a young rat who couldn't

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,199
make up his mind. Whenever the other rats asked him if he would like to come out

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,239
hunting with them, he would answer in a hoarse voice, I don't know. And when they

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:25,239
said, would you rather stay inside, he would say yes or no either. He'd always

5
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:32,880
shake making a choice. One fine day his Aunt Josephine said to him, now look here,

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,919
no one will ever care for you if you carry on like this. You have no more mind

7
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:42,919
of your own than a greasy old blade of grass. The young rat coughed and looked quiet as

8
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:49,919
usual but said nothing. Don't you think so, said his aunt, stamping her foot, for she

9
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:56,479
couldn't bear to see the young rat so cold-blooded. I don't know was all he

10
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,959
ever answered and then he walked off to think.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,000
One night, the rats heard a loud noise in the loft.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It was a very dreary old place, the roof let the rain come down, come washing in.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The beams and the rafters had all rotted through, so the whole thing was quite unsafe.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
At last, one of the joists gave way, and the beams fell with one edge on the floor.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The walls shook, the cupola fell off, and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This won't do, said the leader. We can't stay cooped up here any longer.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So they sent out scouts to search for a new home.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A little later on that evening, the scouts came back and said they had found an old-fashioned horse farm.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,079
For there would be room board for all of them. The leader gave the order at once,

20
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,960
continue following in. And the rats crawled out of the hole right away and stood on the floor in a long line.

21
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,139
Just then the old rat caught sight of young Arthur. That was the name of the

22
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:23,440
shaker. He wasn't in the line and he wasn't exactly outside it. He stood just

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:32,000
by it. Come on, get in line. Growled the old rat coarsely. Of course you're coming too.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,959
I don't know, said Arthur calmly. Why the idea of it. You don't think it's safe here

25
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:48,080
anymore, do you? I'm not certain, said Arthur undaunted. The roof may not fall down yet.

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,279
Well, said the old rat, you can't wait for us to, for you to join us. Then he

27
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:57,759
turned to the other and shot it right about the face. Marked. And the long line

28
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,520
marched out.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,640
I think I'll go tomorrow, he said to himself, but then again, perhaps I won't.

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,520
It's so nice and snug here, I guess I'll go back to my hole under the log for a while,

31
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,520
just to make up my mind.

32
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,000
But during the night, there was a big crash.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,280
Down came beams, rafters, joists, the whole business.

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,079
Last morning, it was a foggy day, some men came to look over the damage.

35
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,599
It seemed odd to them that the old building was not haunted by rats.

36
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,799
But at last, one of them happened to move aboard, and he caught sight of a young rat,

37
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,119
quite dead, half in and half out of his hole.

38
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:45,799
Thus, the shirker got his due, and there was no mourning for him.
