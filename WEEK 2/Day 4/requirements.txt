#openai: For interacting with GPT models.
#anthropic: For interacting with Claude models.
#python-dotenv: For loading your .env file secrets.
#requests: For fetching data from the news API.
#aiohttp: This allows for Asynchronous communication. While requests is great for one-off calls, aiohttp lets your app handle many API requests at once without "blocking" or slowing down, which is essential for high-performance news fetching.
#tiktoken: This is OpenAI’s official library for Token Management. It allows you to count exactly how many tokens a prompt uses before you send it to the API, helping you stay within your "Daily Budget" and avoid surprise costs.
#pytest: This is the industry-standard Testing Framework. We will use it in your test_summarizer.py file to automatically verify that your code works correctly every time you make a change.
